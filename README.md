# Theme 3: TalkBack

#TalkBackPlus

TalkBackPlus is a TalkBack framework which help developers to create applications for visually challenged people. It facilitates consumer developers to write code in a traditional way  and on a flag change just switch application for normal users and visually challenged people.

The best part of TalkBackPlus is that you don't have to worry about writing separate codes for two kinds of users. 


PS- This is not just a talk back.
